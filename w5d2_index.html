    To make homemade applesauce gather a bunch of apples– whichever apples you want (see above). In nearly all apple recipes
    I use Pink Lady Apples because they’re tart, crispy and so pink. Basically, the only thing that matters when picking
    apples. Just kidding…but, that’s how I do things.

  Peel and core the apples. If you’re handy enough with an apple peeler, that will definitely help speed the process
  along. Unfortunately, I have never been clever enough to figure out how to use mine (true story) so I stick to my
  favorite paring knife. Peel, core, and slice the peeled apples into large slices.
  
  Transfer the apples to a large pot. Add the water, lemon juice, sweetener, cinnamon, and salt and mix to combine. You
  don’t need a lot of liquid, however, you will need approximately 1/2 cup to help steam the apples and move things along.
  Some people use apple juice or apple cider instead of water, but I just see that as more sugar, so I’ll let you decide.
  
  Bring liquid to a boil, reduce heat, and cover. Now the hard part is over (since, you know, that was super hard). Allow
  the apples to cook for approximately 25-30 minutes. Your apples should be broken up, buy partially intact, and very
  soft. Remove those sweet apples from heat.
  Make into applesauce. Mash or puree, which will you choose?
